# DataInsights

This GitHub repository showcases a collection of data analysis projects across multiple industries, including Finance, Energy, Credit, Hospitality, Retail, Media, and Food. These projects demonstrate my expertise in data analysis and highlight my experience in working with diverse datasets.

## Statistical Modeling Techniques

The projects in this repository utilize various statistical modeling techniques, including:

- Hypothesis (A/B) Testing: Conducting experiments to evaluate the impact of different variables or interventions, and statistically analyzing the results to draw meaningful conclusions.

- Multivariate Analysis: Exploring the relationships between multiple variables and identifying patterns or correlations using techniques such as correlation analysis, factor analysis, or principal component analysis.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

The projects also employ a range of machine learning algorithms, allowing for deeper insights and predictive modeling. The machine learning techniques used include:

- Classification: Building models to categorize data into different classes or categories based on input features.

- Regression: Employing regression models, such as linear regression, logistic regression, or lasso regression, to understand the relationships between variables and make predictions based on continuous or categorical outcomes.

- Clustering: Utilizing clustering algorithms like K-means, hierarchical clustering to group similar data points together based on their characteristics or similarities, uncovering hidden patterns or segments within the data.

- Decision Tree: Constructing decision tree models to make predictions or classification decisions by recursively splitting the data based on different feature conditions.

- Random Forest: Employing ensemble learning techniques such as random forest, which combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and handle complex datasets.

Feel free to explore the individual projects within this repository to gain insights into the data analysis processes, techniques, and methodologies employed. Each project folder contains its own README file with detailed information, instructions, and results.
