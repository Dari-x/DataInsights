## Course: Model Tuning

Welcome to ReneWind! This project focuses on improving the machinery and processes involved in the production of wind energy using machine learning techniques. ReneWind has collected data on generator failures in wind turbines using sensors. Our objective is to build various classification models, tune them, and find the best model that can accurately identify failures. This will help in proactively repairing generators before they fail or break, thereby reducing the overall maintenance costs.

## Skills & Tools Covered

Throughout this project, we will cover the following skills and tools:

- Up and Downsampling
- Regularization

- Hyperparameter Tuning
